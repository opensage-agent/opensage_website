# Entry Points

OpenSage has three main entry points for different use cases:

1. **[OpenSage Web Entry](OpenSage-Web-Entry.md)** - Interactive web UI for development and debugging
2. **[Evaluation Entry](Evaluation-Entry.md)** - Batch evaluation on benchmarks
3. **[RL Framework Integration](RL-Integration.md)** - Integration with RL frameworks (slime, verl, areal) for agent training

Each entry point has a different workflow and use case. Click on the links above to see detailed step-by-step workflows.
