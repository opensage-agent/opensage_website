Welcome to the OpenSage Development Documentation!

OpenSage (Open Self-programming Agent Generation Engine) is an AI agent framework built on top of Google ADK.

### Self-generating Agent Topology

- Dynamic creation/execution/termination of sub-agents
- Vertical topology and horizontal topology
- Agent ensemble mechanism

### Dynamic Tool Synthesis

- Dynamic tool synthesis and management
- Tool-specific sandboxing and tool state management
- Domain-specific tool set tailored to software engineering and security tasks

### Hierarchical Memory Management

- Short-term memory: graph-based short-term memory
- Long-term memory: a graph managed by Neo4j and stored in a separate database
- Memory agent: equipped with memory read and write tools
